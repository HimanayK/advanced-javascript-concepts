/*
 Event Capturing in JavaScript 
Event capturing starts from the topmost DOM element and propagates downward to the target element. 

 
 Key Points: 

Events move from root to target during capturing. 

Use true as the third argument in addEventListener to capture events. 

You can stop the event's propagation using event.stopPropagation().
